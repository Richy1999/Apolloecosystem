Customer service pushed it as cosmetic, but no one wants their brand new $1200 scooter to not be perfect upon arrival. Made the customer feel like the problem. Customer service did come through and solved the issue with a replacement, but the process was more frustrating than I would have expected. I hope Apollo analyzes the manner in which the Go is packaged and addresses the potential for the brake cable to be cut by rubbing interaction with the handlebar assembly. Second scooter was perfect upon arrival. It did introduce a creaking type sound after first ride. Found that silicone on the rear rubber shock did fix the issue.

My e-bike had a top speed of 25 mph, but that was only going downhill with me pedal assisting like a crazy person. Pan to my new Apollo City. First, it’s sleek, modern, and beautiful to look at. I see lots of heads turning as it’s a force. Second, its performance matches how it looks. Like a luxury sports car (sorry for mixing analogies). Its velocity pick up is insane. Going 25mph is now my normal “middle speed” en route to 32mph, which I can achieve even when wearing a very heavy backpack and weighing 190lb. But the biggest reason I gave this a 10 is that it is SO FUN! I kinda feel the glee of a little kid when I’m riding it (and I’m 52). My wife asks me if I want to get dropped off at work with her car and I’m like “nope”,  because I’d been looking forward to my commute since I woke up.

h9pfwus534ef6q157s3bnh9pfwusvv5x,1,"There is a big difference between renting an hourly scooter and owning one where you have to do all of the maintenance to keep it running. I am a novice scooter owner, I don't think Apollo did enough to onboard me as a new scooter OWNER to fully understand how to use and own a scooter. 

For example, I had my throttle ""go out"" as in I was getting an error message that the throttle had no power. I freaked out thinking I had bought a lemon only to find out after doing some online research that THEIR PHONE MOUNT had shifted during riding and was too close to the throttle and was pinching it. 

Or on the box, Apollo claims my scooter has a 42 mile range but I've only ever seen it at 22 miles. As it turns out the mile range changes depending on the mode and not only that I can adjust the speed higher than the default so I can adjust my comfort mode up to 25 mph instead of the base 15, so switching to that mode after getting up to speed in sport mode saves battery and increases the distance I can ride. 

Maybe these tips are available somewhere but they were not obviously surfaced to me as a new scooter owner and I had to figure out all of this stuff on my own. 

Not to mention there are other issues I have with the hardware. For example, the handlebar is shaped in such a way that there isn't room to add accessories without an extender. It would be nice if a product advertised as a commuter scooter had space to add side mirrors since while commuting you are going to be frequently in traffic and it's hard to have good situational awareness while wearing a helmet which they recommend.",3,5,4,2,,5,3,3,Commuting,,I did weeks of extensive reserach into electric scooters and evaluating my needs and landed on Apollo that fit the bill.

tmy3pm42cul2n87dtmy3pm4grtz56dcr,4,"TLDR; I want to like it, it's not working right now. Apollo missed a sales opportunity. The app needs some work. Failing CASL right now.

So, there's a bunch here, but you asked for feedback, so here it is.

Background, I'm a Software Engineering Manager. I have worked in ecommerce (with Shopify's largest partner) and done a tonne of privacy work (CASL/GDPR/etc...). I have been on the other side of these emails and reviews, I know how it feels. I am writing this with the intent of helping your team improve. I really think the product you make is super cool and I do want Apollo to succeed. I am very open to email/phone responses.

So, I really want to like my scooter. BUT it has been inoperable for over half the time I've had it. I received it on April 29th, but I have been unable to use it since May 6th.

The first issue that occurred was on Monday May 6th. I went to an event, I used a bike lock to lock it up, but thought I'd try out the parking mode in the app. At the end of the night (after 11pm) I went to leave and I could not unpark my scooter. It was asking for a PIN, but I had not entered a PIN, I had never been prompted for one. I tried a number of things (my phone pin/other ideas), but I had no idea what it was looking for. I felt stranded and needed to find a ride home. This was really not fun and not a situation that other Apollo customers should experience. Thankfully, all it cost was a friend's time and gas, but it could have been difficult or costly to get home safely.

The next morning, I turned my scooter on to go for a ride, but I got an error saying F1. It turns out this is a brake issue. I checked everything it and it looked fine. I have been in touch with support a number of times and they have done some troubleshooting with me. Last week (May 9th) they placed the order for the new parts but I had to follow up today (May 14th) as I had not yet received the order confirmation (got it today). I'm not sure how long the shipping will take, I expect a shipping tracking number within the next 48 hours.

I'll also mention that at the event on Monday, I was with my brother and he brought his two year old Apollo City. We had a great ride out. At the venue, we had a friend who is looking for an ebike/scooter option. I told him he could try mine out. Of course, instead of taking it for a spin, at the end of the night he watched me try to unlock my scooter for several minutes before I had to give up. It was not a good sales pitch.

I have been in contact with support. Tactically, it has been helpful (solid B+). However, I don't believe the support team is dealing with the strategic issues (it's not really their main objective of course). It really feels like there are some larger strategic issues occurring here.

I did feel a bit upset earlier too. In the back-and-forth with support, it was implied that the parking issue was my fault (user error). I am very unsure how could it be my fault that an Apollo pin (888888) was assigned to the parked scooter without my input or confirmation. Also, given that no one has asked how it occurred, it doesn't feel like it's getting the importance I feel it should.

Again, my brand new scooter $2,000 has been out of commission for over half the time I've owned it. I've only put 70kms on it. I've had to change my commute arrangements several times due to this outage. 

All in all, when I ride the scooter, it's fantastic, maybe a touch heavy, but hey, I signed up for that.

For the final aspect, the CASL issue. If you look at my order (CAD38193) you'll see that I did not sign up for marketing emails. I know I didn't, because I very deliberately do not sign up for them. However, I am receiving them. I have literally had to deal with this on the other side, I know that sometimes the mapping from Shopify to MailChimp (or whatever) is not configured properly. I'm not poking the government, just wanted you to be aware before someone does. I do know I can unsubscribe, I'll remove myself soon.

Again, I have seen my brothers scooter and he loves it. I do want this to be a great experience for me, I really hope the handlebar replacement solves the problem. But for now, I can't give a high NPS because it hasn't been a great experience.

Right now you show the overal trip stats and a map of my route, but I would like additional metrics.

There are texts overlapping, settings that don’t actually save, and there are simple features that could be added to make the user have more control. I would recommend looking at the Segway app as they have done it well. Lastly, the scooter has had a few phantom regen braking events that could be extremely dangerous!

The use of the route section does not provide a correction for the distance traveled whereas it uses a GPS to locate itself.  the accessories that come with the scooter are very interesting and of good quality, the bag cannot be installed under the handlebars because of the position of the lamp and the straps are not long enough. the lamp cannot be hung on the handlebar  because the attachment is intended for a round handlebar (bicycle style) and not a large ""square/round"" handlebar, the same for the phone holder.  the lamp, the bag and the support are of good quality.

Lastly, I purchased the apollo bag & the folding lock.

Adding a better post-purchase communication strategy that regularly updates customers about their orders, anticipated delivery times, and any potential delays. The one you have right now is not it.

The stem mechanism kept loosening up and wobbling. My rear tire actually melted and I had to purchase a new one. The screws that hold the kickstand in place actually fell out and I lost the kickstand. I had reached out to Apollo a number of times, including asking to send the scooter back and get a refund. Then your company sent a new throttle and brake set up that I had to pay someone to install. It’s ironic that after everything I went through you guys would not stand behind your product but within eight months you redesigned the scooter and made all these changes to what was a scooter that should not have been sent to market and sold because it was not truly ready to hit the streets.

It’s very tall, stable, wide handlebars, and great suspension, which is great for going at higher speeds. This was a test scooter as I was planning on buying quite a few for all of my business employees as a benefit. However, I’ve been extremely disappointed with the front tire continually going flat when it has not been punctured or damaged. I reached out to support (it took several days for a reply) and they gave me some recommendations and nothing is working. I have to inflate the front tire every day to ride it safely. I cannot have employees riding any thing with this type of flaw as it will become a liability for the company.

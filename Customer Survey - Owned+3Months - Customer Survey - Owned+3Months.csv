Additionally in the app I’ve selected for my app and scooter to auto connect but the will toggle off very consistently which makes no sense. Also as it comes to the amp system you have it where you earn 1 amp per mile. In Canada where Apollo is from I thought you’d have a clear way of displaying how many amps someone is earning while riding and not at the end. As there has been many times where I would ride and I would have only gone a distance of 2.9miles so I’d earn 2 amps. The amount of times I was close to earning that next amp is significantly if you multiply 1 amp a day missing out on 365 amps is a lot over time. I just wish you displayed the amps earned on the app while riding so or simply just round the amps so when someone goes 2.9miles they earn 2.9 amps keep it simple. As I have to ride in mph to see clearly how far Iam from hitting that 0.1 miles to earn the full amount. I think you should be proud of what you’ve accomplished I think the gas saved at the end has to be more accurate I’ve written in to support about this so I’m sure you could find it. Also I think you should put how much co2 we’ve saved from switching from our gas car.,Average,Below expectations,Above expectations,Above expectations,Above expectations,Above expectations,Below expectations,Not applicable,"Product features/specs,Value (spec to price ratio),Support & warranty,Product quality/reliability,Brand/reputation,Price,Ease of use,Servicing infrastructure (repair centres),Ability to test/try the product before buying",1,9,"Cruise Control, I look at regenerative breaking while going down in to see what I’m getting back into battery which I think you should show at the end of the ride how much regenerative breaking you put back in….Apollo is very unique with that system and I think it would show riders how significant it has a part in there ride.",I don’t lock the scooter but if I turn it off I wish it would stay locked meaning the breaks stayed locked but I understand it would use battery.,1,,"Living new Westminster outside of Vancouver I’m an assistant manager at a Safeway store that’s owned by Sobeys so I get transferred from store to store. I live in New Westminster and I had to travel to downtown Vancouver which is about 25-27km one way and Vancouver has more hills then most and this has a significant impact on range. I’ve been transferred to further stores in Richmond and it take forever to get there. I know we have the skytrain, but what’s the point in a scooter if I have to use the train. Also the train doesn’t go everywhere. I’d like to be able to go to New Westminster to Langley and back all in one charge with significant battery left to do errands. Again I might be a very unique rider but I’d like to go way farther and take my scooter everywhere but it’s not possible as it’s a matter of will I have enough battery left to get me back. Also speed can be an issue. I don’t need a scooter to go 100kph on a flat ground but being able to go faster up hill so traffic I’m sharing the road with aren’t pissed, we have many hills in new west and slowly going up the hill had an impact. I just need the potential speed to go up with riding uphill. Also I know your community is growing but have no a community leaderboard or something for riders to challenge one another of some sorts would be cool. Also maybe put out a poll for a potential feature that riders would like and make it a multiple choice option and they can decide on something I know this would engage the community.","This is from an outsiders perspective so I can only see it through one lense because I don’t know what you’ve tried or not. All I can say is the Simon Sinek book why. I think you need to to ask yourself why would someone buy an Apollo. Yes Regen is nice and you know as well as I do you’ll never please everyone, but what makes you different. I’m sure each of you on the team have either an android or iPhone why do those platforms and OS work for you. Why did you choose that and why do you continue to choose it. Same idea with a scooter why would someone choose you over a competitor. I will say the more the community is involved the more support you’ll have.","I’m sure all of you work hard most days trying to push the bounds of what you thought was possible. I’m sure all of you that started Apollo and were there in the beginning look at today thinking how did we accomplish all of this from reselling and rebranding to making our own high quality scooter. There are many companies that have the same foundation of a business. The question you need to ask yourself if you were to remove all the labels off of every brand where its phones, cars or literally anything there are many things that do the same thing just someone else makes it. What makes Apollo different. Look at the iPhone vs android there are loyal people on both sides but anyone who owns an android will say to the phone user who got a feature that was on android already for 5+ years and the iPhone user is excited where the android user is laughing. iPhone has about 1.5 billion iOS users where android has 4 billion. Which is shocking but what does android do different. Oneplus was starting and thrived off of community feedback and wants from the user. Let the user be as involved as they can. Put out polls to ask the community what they want everyone wants to be apart of something special. Eloi I’m sure you see and can think of so many cool features. But imagine what 1000 people could come up with and vote. Any successful business will either succeed or fail based on the community. Make the community so invested in Apollo they would never want to leave to nami or wolf king. As an example I could have easily bought a nami burn e 2max so in could ride longer but I believe in you all that you will make all the right decision with some setbacks from time to time. Regardless be proud of what you’ve done.",completed,16/08/2024 05:11,,16/08/2024 06:03,0722d84ce3,

I think you should try to avoid releasing so many versions because it makes it look like, either you don’t stand by your original designs or that you’re trying to grab cash (sort of like Apple). Maybe release versions less close together. Otherwise I’m very happy. I feel like support is there if I need it, and I love my GO. It’s more than I expected in terms of sturdiness and performance. In the future I’ll consider adding a phantom depending on my ability to store a heavier scooter. The app connectivity is a bit spotty and it can take a bit of playing around to connect, so that could maybe be improved. It’d also be cool to see you guys work with local government (at least in Montreal) to keep the peace and perhaps create a type of paid scooter docking system that would make it safer to lock up scooters in the city. 
Thanx for the great mobility experience!

Continue to build a strong warranty program with your new and existing customers. Having ProMec available to us in BC was a good start.,Don’t have anything in mind now.,Continue to build your brand in being transparent in the amount of work you guys put into designing and testing each of your scooters.  Those  friends and colleagues of mine that purchased Apollo scooter’s truly appreciated the labour of love and the videos that captured the different tigers stages of testing you put into each line of Apollo scooters.  It builds consumer trusts into your brand especially when we are prepared to spend that much money into your scooter.  I would continue to build and strengthen your customer service side of the house - response time and being able to troubleshoot issues would be important and something that would separate yourselves with your competition.  Your brand will continue to sell itself from your online presents and from previous satisfied customers like myself where we are happily to promote your brand to others knowing that the above points are supported by Apollo.  Keep up the good work! - Gary Yeung,completed,15/08/2024 12:19,,15/08/2024 12:46,813404af73,

I support your brand publicly however, your shipping is horrific.  You over promise and under deliver at every opportunity.  Fix your supply chain, promise two week delivery and strive for one week.  That will turn customer anger and frustration into surprise and passion for your brand.  QA is also a challenge for Apollo.  Your target audience considers their scooter purchase as Major purchase.  They want car like quality and service.  You need to work on the ""wow"" factor by ensuring the scooter is perfect.  There is nothing worse than building on the expectation of delivery only to find it won't work or there is a scratch or its broken.  This is the huge challenge as you don't have the opportunity for dealer prep before the customer sees the product for the first time.",completed,15/08/2024 11:29,,15/08/2024 11:47,3b7e8d8d97,
